Headers- are extra informations which tells what type of data is present in the request or coming
from the request.
we can create custom header using-
res.setHeader('X-myName', 'Ayush Pal');
best practice is to write X- infront of the key.
we can send headers at the request time in postman app itself for 
request headers.


Promises chaining--
returning another promises inside of the .then()'s callback function
and using it.

DATABASES-
There are 2 types of databases SQL (structured query language) and No-SQL database.
The only difference between both of these is that SQL databases like- MySQL, PostgreSQL 
they work on relations (RDBMS) they work on tables
and No SQL databases works on documents.

mongoDB is a No-SQL document based database which works on BSON format.
best for node apps, it has strong support for aggregation pipes.
