check for connetion using this command- mongosh
check for databases- show dbs 
to create collection - db.createCollection('collectionName');
to check for all collections- show collection
to insert data in the collection- db.collectionName.insert({'name': 'Ayush'});

note- without any data inside of your db you'll not see your db in the show dbs, you'll need to enter some data inside of it 
to see it in the db section.


to use any database- use databaseName
to find all the entries in a collection by passing empty object- db.collectionName.find({});


HOW DOES MONGOOSE WORK-
We create a Schema to Define the structure
schema ko use karke model banate hai 
& using the model we do CRUD operation
