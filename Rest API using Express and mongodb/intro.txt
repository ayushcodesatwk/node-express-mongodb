Hello everyone!
My name is Ayush Pal, and I'm from Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh. 
I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics from IPS Academy,Indore, 
in 2021. 
I became interested in IT and started learning to code, 
but many of the courses I took didn't work out for me. 
Recently, I completed a web development course from sharpener.tech, 
which helped me land this job as an Associate Software Engineer. 
That's all about me. Thank you!"
